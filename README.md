# TwitterSpi

Twitter tweets are analysed using text mining libraries in R programming language. The analysis is then used to determine ideologies and optimism level of a person, or to review a new gadget or a movie. It can also be used to investigate about social/political sentiments at a particular place or just to know why the world is so over a hash-tag.
